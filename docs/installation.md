Installing `b`
========================================================================================================================
B is available on PyPi and can be installed using pip with the following command:

    # pip install b-bugtracker

> **_Note:_** The name of the PyPI package "b-bugtracker" is different from the command line name "b" due to a collision with an existing, but seemingly empty, `b` package.

Once installed, `b` can be accessed from the command line using the `b` command.

Try running:

    $ b version

To see the version number of `b` that was just installed and to verify that it's working.

> **_Note:_** You may need to restart or, at least, log out/in for the changes to your PATH to take effect.  If `b` does not work after installation, try one of these options before digging too deep into the problem.
