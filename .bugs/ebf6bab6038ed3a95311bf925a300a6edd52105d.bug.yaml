type: Feature
paths:
- b.bugs
what: Add support for better templates to the tool.
why: It would be really nice to have support for more than one type of bug template.
how: |-
  In keeping with the spirit of simplicity with this tool a simple set of
  template files in a "templates" directory would suffice.

  In keeping with the feature of overriding templates, templates from the
  project should supersede those defaults in the tool.

  Further, the tool should support creating a template in the project
  .bugs directory from the default in the tool and open it in the editor
  for tailoring.
