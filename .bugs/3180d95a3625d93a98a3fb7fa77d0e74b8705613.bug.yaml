what: Add a new command w/ parser to support verifying all existing bugs.
why: There is no way for a user to know if their manual edits made to bugs violate
  the schema.
how: |-
  Would be ideal if the schema could be used to handle the validation.

  It is not expected that the tool would handle any "fixes".  Simply report them and
  let the user correct them manually and rerun the verification.
