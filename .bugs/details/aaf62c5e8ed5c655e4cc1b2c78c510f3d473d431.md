## What
Change from plain text (.txt) files to Markdown (.md) files for details files.


## Why
I'm already encouraging the use of Markdown in the .txt files.  Switching the
file extension means that editors such as VSCode will actually treat it as such
and provide handy editing features and highlighting to boot.



## How
Should be as simple as changing the file extensions.

Might want to consider a migration?  Handle converting existing .txt files
to .md files?

I think that it also make sense to change the sections from "[boxed]" format,
as sexy as they are, to Markdown "## Headings" for consistency.
