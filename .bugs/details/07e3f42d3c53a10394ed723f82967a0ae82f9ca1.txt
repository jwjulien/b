[what]
Move the title of the bug from the dict into the detail file as the first line of text.


[why]
It's very annoying to need to keep switching between the details file and the dict
to check bug titles.



[how]
Switch the BugDict from using an odd dict to support bug attributes into a new
Bug class with properties.  The BugDict can then be turned into a BugList, perhaps,
and sort by ID.

If going this route, I would also recommend moving other metadata from the dict into
the details files, such as open/closed status, creation date, creation user, assigned
user, etc.  They are all just plain text fields anyways and I don't like that you have
to cross reference the bugs dict to find the title for a bug.

Further, I think this new Bug class needs to be able to parse the text into memory and
support writing the bug file back out.  That way, things like comments and properties
can be adjusted easily.  Be mindful of user-added whitespace though.
