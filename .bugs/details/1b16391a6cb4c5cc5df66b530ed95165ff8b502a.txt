[details]
It would be nice if the tool was smart enough that the comments section
didn't have to be at the end of the file.


[expected]
Comments could be added to the middle of the file.


[actual]
Comments are always appended to the end of the file, no matter what
section that is.


[reproduce]
1. Create a bug and launch the editor.
2. Append a new section called "[test]" to the end of the bug detail file.
3. Use the comment command to add a new comment.
4. Observe that the new comment has been added to the "test" section.
