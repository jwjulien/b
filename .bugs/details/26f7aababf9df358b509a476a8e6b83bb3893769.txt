At this point there isn't much need for Mercurial integration.  B works
great as a standalone command line tool and can be used with any version
control system with ease, including Mercurial (without the integration).

The integration effectively means there are two different "interfaces"
to support now, the Mercurial interface and the command line interface.
At the time of this writing, the new template support isn't even supported
by the Mercurial integration.

So, I think that it makes sense to finally axe the ties to my beloved
Mercurial and to instead just focus on a simpler tool with the best
command line support that I can possibly offer.
