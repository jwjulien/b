[what]
Consider adding support for a [tags] section in a bugs details.

To allow tagging with things like "feature" or "bug" and then generating
reports of the same.  Would be a great way to categorize open reports.



[how]
- Add a new [tags] section into templates.
- Support one tag per line.
- Add a new "tags" command to the parser with support for filtering by tag.
- Integrate the tags into the listing of open bugs.
