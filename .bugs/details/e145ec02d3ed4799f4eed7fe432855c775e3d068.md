## Paths
b.command


## What
Rework the settings to add more capabilities and distance from being tied
to Mercurial.


## Why
I very much like this tool and would like to use it more for my day job,
however, they are not big users of Mercurial.

It seems a shame to force the use of Mercurial upon the end user as B is
already great as a standalone command line bug tracking tool.



## How
Change settings from using Mercurial.ini to a custom config.

Consider falling back onto mercurial.ini for username when not
specified in the new config.

Add a config command, similar to what Poetry uses, to allow the user
to list, get, and set various settings directly from the command line.

Consider a package such as `usersettings` to store these settings in
an OS appropriate location.
