It would be really nice to have support for more than one type of bug
template.

In keeping with the spirit of simplicity with this tool a simple set of
template files in a "templates" directory would suffice.

In keeping with the feature of overriding tempaltes, templates from the
project should superceed those defaults in the tool.

Further, the tool should support creating a template in the project
.bugs directory from the default in the tool and open it in the editor
for tailoring.
