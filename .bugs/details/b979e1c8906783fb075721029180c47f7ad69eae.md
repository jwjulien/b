## Details
It's odd to have to specify a template on first comment or edit, rather than on add.

I also don't want to track the template that was specified in the bugs dictionary as it's not bug related.

Better yet, how about generate a details file on add IF the user specifies a template to be used.

Should edit be triggered too?


## Reproduce
1. Run command `b add -t feature "a new feature"` to generate a new bug with the "feature" template.
    - Example output: "Added bug 6:732fe7a756"
2. Run command `b edit 6` to open the details file in the editor.
3. Observe that the new details file is from the "bug" template instead.


## Expected
Proper template should be used when user specifies along with the `add` command.


## Actual
Default template is used.


## Paths

I think the best approach for this is to just generate an empty details file any time the
template is specified, even if the edit command wasn't invoked.
