Add a new `init` command to generate a new .bugs directory and dictionary.

This would make `b` behave more like Mercurial/Git - needing to initialize the
directory for the tool before using it.

That also means that commands like `add` should fail when `init` has yet to be
run in a project.


[reproduce]
From an empty folder run:

    b add "new bug"


[expected]
Should get an error saying no .bugs directory was found.


[actual]
The tool just creates the .bugs directory and adds a new bug.

Fundamentally this isn't a problem, but in conjunction with another bug
being filed, this will create a new .bugs directory in the current directory
rather than allowing the tool to recursively search upwards for a .bugs directory.
See 1e73840bd212189689842168510a02376add11ce for more detail about this new,
proposed feature.
