what: It might be nice to know how many bugs have been resolved by various users to
  date?
why: To be able to get a report of what users have been historically involved too.
how: |-
  The addition of a new -r flag is trivial.

  I also think that a mutually exclusive -a flag would be welcome, which would list ALL bugs,
  resolved AND open.  It might be nice to include status information here too, like color
  coded green/red for resolved/open, respectively.
