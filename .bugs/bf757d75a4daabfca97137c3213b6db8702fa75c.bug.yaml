type: Bug
reporter: jared
details: |-
  When I try to add the first comment to the end of the file with an
  empty comments section it fails.
reproduce: |-
  1. Create a new bug.
  2. Edit the details file for the new bug to clean out the comments section entirely.
  3. Attempt to add a new comment to the bug.
  4. Observe no error at the command line.
  5. Edit the bug's details file again and observe that the comment has not been added.
expected: Would expect the comment to appear in the details file or an error message.
actual: No error, just doesn't do anything.

fix: |-
  Two pronged:

  1. Add a check in the `comments` method to verify that the contents of the details
     file have changed after the `re` is run and raise an exception if the before and
     after at the same.

  2. Fix the regular expression which clearly isn't matching the completely empty
     comments section scenario.
