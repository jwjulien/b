type: Feature
what: Change from plain text (.txt) files to Markdown (.md) files for details files.
why: |-
  I'm already encouraging the use of Markdown in the .txt files.  Switching the
  file extension means that editors such as VSCode will actually treat it as such
  and provide handy editing features and highlighting to boot.
how: |-
  Should be as simple as changing the file extensions.

  Might want to consider a migration?  Handle converting existing .txt files
  to .md files?

  I think that it also make sense to change the sections from "[boxed]" format,
  as sexy as they are, to Markdown "## Headings" for consistency.
