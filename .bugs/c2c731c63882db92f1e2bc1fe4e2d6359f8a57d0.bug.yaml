what: |-
  Similar to what Mercurial does.

  Provide a new `serve` command that spawns a local webserver and allows the user
  to browse the "bugs" from, well, their browser.
why: |-
  It would be nice to be able to browse and sort burgs using a browser like a GUI.

  I don't have any desire to build a fancy GUI for `b`, so this would be a nice,
  cross-platform compromise.
how: Presumably with a tool like Flask.  Keep the JavaScripts minimal and the UI simple.
