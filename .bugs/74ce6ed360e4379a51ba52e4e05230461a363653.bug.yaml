what: Switch to Pallet Projects Click package for command line interface.
why: |-
  Click has proved to be a MUCH cleaner interface for command line tools like B.

  Click also support partial commands, a feature I have wanted.

  It may be possible to implement a8579894b5213843c944e5dd17fb5495808239ba easier in Click, a task that has proven
  rather difficult with ArgumentParser.
