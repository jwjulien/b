what: Why not use `questionary` to prompt the user for the important details of new
  bugs?
why: The user is currently forced to edit the bug file every time anew bug is added
  to populate relevant fields.  It would be very handy if the tool would walk the
  user through some prompts to fill in the fields instead.
how: |-
  Not sure how this will work with the templates.  Be careful to accept user templates for new bugs still.

  Perhaps we may need tp consider using a different format for the templates that specify types and allow inputs to the interactive steps when adding new bugs.
