  It would be nice if the tool was smart enough that the comments section
  didn't have to be at the end of the file.
expected: Comments could be added to the middle of the file.
actual: |-
  Comments are always appended to the end of the file, no matter what
  section that is.
reproduce:
- 1. Create a bug and launch the editor.
- 2. Append a new section called "[test]" to the end of the bug detail file.
- 3. Use the comment command to add a new comment.
- 4. Observe that the new comment has been added to the "test" section.
