what: Switch ID from SHA1 hash of the current timestamp to UUID4.
why: UUIDs take other factors, like the user's PC serial number, into account to absolutely
  assure unique values.  The current ID mechanism has very low odds of an ID collision,
  but it's not impossible, and an ID collision would ruin the fundamental purpose
  of this bug tracker which is to facilitate distributed development.
how: Best yet, what about the SHA1 hash of a UUID?  That would help assure uniqueness
  while preserving the existing look and feel.

  text: Simply adding a random value to the existing scheme prevents collisions pretty
    well.  A test to attempt to force a collision resulted in greater than 43 billion
    failed attempts before giving up.
