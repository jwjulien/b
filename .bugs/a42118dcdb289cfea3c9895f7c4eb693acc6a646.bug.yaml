type: Feature
what: Consider adding support for a [tags] section in a bugs details.
why: |-
  To allow tagging with things like "feature" or "bug" and then generating
  reports of the same.  Would be a great way to categorize open reports.
how: |-
  - Add a new [tags] section into templates.
  - Support one tag per line.
  - Add a new "tags" command to the parser with support for filtering by tag.
  - Integrate the tags into the listing of open bugs.
decision: |-
  Request denied.

  Not a required feature.  May reconsider in the future, but it's not a feature that I
  need right now and I would prefer to preserve some simplicity for this tool while I
  continue to bloat it out with other features.
