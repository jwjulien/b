type: Feature
what: |-
  Change the bugs directory from containing a "details" directory to using
  directories to dictate open/closed status.
why: |-
  With 07e3f42d3c53a10394ed723f82967a0ae82f9ca1 proposing that attributes
  be moved from the bugs dict into the details files, then there isn't much
  need for a single folder in the bugs directory.

  In addition, using folders makes it fairly clear the status of the bugs
  therein.
how: Use folders to delegate file status such as open/close.
decision: |-
  Reject.

  This sounded good in theory, but will result in issues with the version control
  systems that it was designed to work with.  Resolving a bug would move it from
  an ".bugs/open" to a ".bugs/closed" directory.

  This change is apparent and intuitive to a human, but to the version control (such
  as Mercurial) this is a `delete` of one file and an `add` of another.  Worse, the
  history of the bug gets obscured in the system and would require significant manual
  effort to piece back together.

    This does present an issue where version control will see this as an add/remove rather than a state change.

    Plus there's an issue with bugs possibly appearing in both folders after a merge.
