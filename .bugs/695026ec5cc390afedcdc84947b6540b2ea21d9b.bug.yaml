type: Bug
details: Issuing the `templates` command outside of the root directory (containing
  .bugs) causes the template to not be found.
reproduce:
- 1. cd into a subdirectory of an initialized project.
- 2. Run `b templates`.
- 3. Observe that no templates are listed.
expected: A list of, at least, default templates for the project.
actual: No templates are listed.
problem: B is assuming relative directories when searching for templates.
fix: |-
  Make template directory relative to the bugsdir that was configured.

  Better still, make the path relative to the tool as the tool is likely to be located in another location all together for projects.
