type: Bug
details: |-
  Recursively search up from the current folder to find the .bugs directory
  (or whatever the user has configured the name of the directory to be).

  This behavior would better mimic how `b` would have worked as a Mercurial
  extension, where the commond would work to write the top-level project
  .bugs directory from any sub-direcotry in the project, not just the top level.

  This proposal has one problem - if the bugs directory doesn't exist, then
  how should it be created?  Bug de439ffd9b3ea729d1f2a44be91191ed9995e108 has
  also been submitted suggesting that an init command be added to explicitly
  allow a user to specify when and where a bugs directory should be created.
reproduce: |-
  1. Create a new project with a subdirectory inside.
  2. From the root of the project, run `b add "bug one"`.
  3. Observe that a .bugs directory has been created at the top level.
  4. `cd` into the subdirectory.
  5. Run `b add "a second bug"`.
  6. Observe that a new `.bugs` directory has been created in the subdirectory.
expected: |-
  The "second bug" should have been added to the base ".bugs" directory of the
  top-level project folder, along with "bug one".
actual: |-
  A new ".bugs" directory was created in the subfolder with "second bug" added
  only to that.
fix: |-
  From the absolute path of the current working directory, walk up the
  directory structure searching for a path containing the bugs directory.
  Stop at the first match and use it.

  If no directory can be found, then throw an error indicating such.
